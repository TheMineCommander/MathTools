# Useful math tools

## 3VarSystems.py:
Use this to find the solution of a three-dimensional system.
Input is pretty self-explanatory, you're using a matrix.

## binomials.py
Square binomials and factor a perfect-square trinomial. (NOT VERY USEFUL, USE `factorquadratics.py`)
Input is self-explanatory.

## factorquadratics.py
A very simple program to factor and find the solution(s) to a quadratic.
Sample run:
```
A: 2
B: 3
C: 1
2(x+1.0)(x+0.5)

The solutions to the graph are -1.0 and -0.5
```

## simplifyradicals.py
Simplify radicals down as much as possible.
Sample run (split in segments):
```
Welcome! This program will find the simplest form of a radical.
To use it, input the outside variable and the radicand. Tip: If there is no outside variable, use 1.
